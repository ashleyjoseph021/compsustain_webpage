    <p> Why does this matter? Why should you care about computational sustainability? </p> 
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"> 
	    There are so many interesting applications and research being done in this field. 
	    It has so much potential to do good and help better the planet. 
	    It may sound boring and sound like it is just a bunch of technical jargon, but it is more than that. 
	    There is so much that computational sustainability could help and improve.</p>

    <p> Examining Multiple Perspectives:  </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"> Computational sustainability does have its limitations and possible downsides. Not everyone believes that computational sustainability is helping more than it is hindering. Looking at this from different perspectives raises multiple possible issues. Large structures or large systems/programs could inhibit both humans, wildlife, and vegetation. While it is a good idea it might not help or be able to be implemented in a variety of settings. The solutions created could be costly thus not being able to be used in a different situation. The environmental impact of creating the solutions or systems could be more than the amount that it helps. It could be a waste. These perspectives are touched in Deya Chatterjee and Shrisha Rao’s article “Computational Sustainability: A Socio-technical Perspective”. </p>

      … a growth in consumption of resources, given improved efficiency of resource utilization, is known as the “Jevons’ Paradox” [Alcott 2005] and has led some to conclude that improvements in the efficiency of resource utilization are insufficient for resource conservation and sustainability [Polimeni 2012]. (Chatterjee and Rao 101:16)

  <p style="margin-left: 40px" >The authors include the example of paper use after the introduction of electronic systems. It was found that more paper was used after the supposed sustainable upgrade. While all these perspectives are valid and deserve to be explored and thought over, overall computational sustainability has had a positive impact on sustainability. </p>
